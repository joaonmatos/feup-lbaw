## Theme 1 - Collaborative News

This project aims to redefine how media is curated and how users find out about what is going on in the world. In a world where media publication is both broader (more publications) and more specialized than ever, being able to present the user with the stories that are most relevant to them is an ever more relevant, important and rewarding proposition. With the amount of fake news also on the rise, we should also aim to introduce systems that can help us filter them out.
